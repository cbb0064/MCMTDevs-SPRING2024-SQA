This directory has the files that were committed from the local cloned directory and shows proof that the push from ubuntu was done to the actual repo on github. The files good.py and good2.py
were commited using git push and a remote token, pre-commit.sample is the actual hook that was pushed to the repo (it has been renamed and applied), bad.py was used for testing and did not commit
whem added solo and did not inhibit good files from committing even when also in the queue
