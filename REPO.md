# Software Quality Assurance Project Report (COMP 5710/6710) 

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to integrate SQA activities into a provided zip file (MLForensics.zip). These activities include adding Git Hooks, fuzzing, foresics, and continuous integration. A

## Fuzzing

Fuzzing is a testing method where software is bombarded with diverse and often unexpected inputs to uncover bugs or vulnerabilities. Fuzz Image 1 shows how the program responds to various inputs, while Fuzz Image 2 displays the list of inputs used for testing. By examining how the program handles these inputs, developers can identify potential issues such as crashes or security flaws. Automated tools are often employed to streamline this process.

## Continuous Integration

Adding continuous integration allows static analysis of code that developers upload. It runs on a code repository whenever specified, such as a set time schedule or on a pull request. This allows for easy debugging and formatting of code across different versions of the code, as seen in CI Image 1 below. When opening the static analysis, various errors and warnings can be seen, as seen in CI Image 2 below. Continuous integration provides easier transition upon versions of code so that work across multiple developers can be easily integrated with pre-existing code.
