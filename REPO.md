## Software Quality Assurance Project Report (COMP 5710/6710) 

### Project Description

The purpose of this project is to integrate SQA activities into a provided zip file (MLForensics.zip). These activities include adding Git Hooks, fuzzing, foresics, and continuous integration. A

### Continuous Integration

Adding continuous integration allows static analysis of code that developers upload. It runs on a code repository whenever specified, such as a set time schedule or on a pull request. This allows for easy debugging and formatting of code across different versions of the code, as seen in CI Image 1 below. When opening the static analysis, various errors and warnings can be seen, as seen in CI Image 2 below. Continuous integration provides easier transition upon versions of code so that work across multiple developers can be easily integrated with pre-existing code.
